# CSGO DeepL Translator
A Software to translate CSGO communications using a Telnet connection.

# Important
this application uses the DeepL API so you need an API key which you can get [here](support.deepl.com/hc/de/articles/360021200939-DeepL-API-Free) for free.

I recommend to test the program before you request a key.

# How to use
1. Set the CS:GO launch options: -condebug & -netconport 2121
